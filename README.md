Hi there!

I’m currently immersed in a full-stack Big Data, Data Science, Machine Learning, and AI bootcamp at KeepCoding, I blend my passion for technology with a background in philosophy to explore cutting-edge AI. I’m a curious mind who loves to investigate, experiment, and push boundaries—always eager to discover new insights and create innovative solutions.

Beyond coding and data crunching, I’m focused on living a more mindful life, believing that thoughtful awareness and empathy are key drivers for meaningful tech. When I’m not immersed in Python, deep learning, or NLP projects, you’ll likely find me skateboarding—yes, it’s my favorite way to stay active, spark creativity, and have a bit of fun!

I thrive on challenges and welcome opportunities to collaborate on projects that harness technology for real-world impact. My vision is to fuse analytical rigor, philosophical thinking, and a human-centered approach to shape the future of AI. 

Thanks for stopping by—let’s connect and build something amazing together🫱🏽‍🫲🏽!
